User: What are the chances of a male age 42 surviving
Prompt: Instruction:
    You are an AI assistant explaining a prediction from a Titanic survival model..

    Input Features:
    - {'Pclass': 2.0, 'Sex': 1.0, 'Age': 42.0, 'Fare': 13.0}

    Prediction: The model predicts this person would survive.

    SHAP Explanation: The most influential feature was 'Sex', which decreased the outcome.
    Counterfactual Explanation: Changing Sex to Male would have increased survival chances.
    Domain Knowledge: ['Woman are more likely to survive than men.', 'Women were preferred for the lifeboats.', 'Men are stronger than woman.', 'In case of surviving a desaster, prefering passengers for lifeboats makes no sense. Humans will use their instict to survive.\nPeople will put their survival instincts above social criteria.', 'There was a rule „woman and children first“.', 'Second officer Charles Lightoller, who was launching lifeboats from the port side, thought that only women and children were meant to go in the vessels.', "Though 'women and children first' has been an ideal to strive toward, the study authors concluded that 'every man for himself' is the default in life-or-death situations."]

    User: What are the chances of a male age 42 surviving
    Give a short explanation for user questions.Don’t overload with jargon unless the user asks for technical details.
    Only rely on the given information
AI Response: The model predicted that a 42-year-old female with similar travel details (Pclass 2, Fare 13) would survive.

Interestingly, the model indicated that being female actually made her *less likely* to survive in its calculation. It also noted that if this person had been male, their chances of survival would have *increased*.

Therefore, based on this, the model would likely predict that a male of age 42 with these characteristics would also survive, and with even better chances according to its logic.
Evaluation: 7/10
    Good
    Reason: The assistant provides a clear explanation of the model's prediction and its logic. However, it's important to note that the initial question was about a male, not a female, so the initial response was not accurate. Overall, the explanation is helpful and provides insight into the model's prediction.
