User: which is the most important feature
Prompt: Instruction:
    You are an AI assistant explaining a prediction from a Titanic survival model..

    Input Features:
    - {'Pclass': 2.0, 'Sex': 1.0, 'Age': 42.0, 'Fare': 13.0}

    Prediction: The model predicts this person would survive.

    SHAP Explanation: The most influential feature was 'Sex', which decreased the outcome.
    Counterfactual Explanation: Changing Sex to Male would have increased survival chances.
    Domain Knowledge: ['Woman are more likely to survive than men.', 'Women were preferred for the lifeboats.', 'Men are stronger than woman.', 'In case of surviving a desaster, prefering passengers for lifeboats makes no sense. Humans will use their instict to survive.\nPeople will put their survival instincts above social criteria.', 'There was a rule „woman and children first“.', 'Second officer Charles Lightoller, who was launching lifeboats from the port side, thought that only women and children were meant to go in the vessels.', "Though 'women and children first' has been an ideal to strive toward, the study authors concluded that 'every man for himself' is the default in life-or-death situations."]

    Give a short explanation for user questions.Don’t overload with jargon unless the user asks for technical details.
AI Response: The most important feature influencing this prediction was **Sex**.

The model indicates that being male (as indicated by the 'Sex' value of 1.0) decreased this person's chances of survival.

AI Response: The model highlights 'Sex' because historically, during the Titanic disaster, there was a strong emphasis on the "women and children first" policy for lifeboat evacuation.

This meant that being male significantly decreased a person's chances of getting a spot on a lifeboat, thus making 'Sex' a very influential factor in determining survival.

    User: what are the other feature that can influence the prediction
    Give a short explanation for user questions.Don’t overload with jargon unless the user asks for technical details.
AI Response: Besides **Sex**, other features that can influence the prediction include:

*   **Passenger Class (Pclass):** Your Pclass was 2.0 (Second Class). Generally, passengers in higher classes had better access to the upper decks and lifeboats. So, being in Second Class could offer a better chance than Third Class, but less than First Class.
*   **Age:** Your age was 42.0. While the "women and children first" policy was in effect, being an adult male typically meant a lower priority for lifeboats compared to children.
*   **Fare:** Your fare was 13.0. The fare often correlates with the passenger class, and can sometimes indirectly indicate cabin location, which might affect how quickly one could reach the lifeboats.

    Give a short explanation for user questions.Don’t overload with jargon unless the user asks for technical details.
AI Response: If the fare were lower, it might indicate a lower passenger class or a less advantageous cabin location on the ship.

Generally, a lower fare could slightly decrease the predicted survival chances, as passengers who paid less often had cabins on lower decks, making it harder and slower to reach the lifeboats.
